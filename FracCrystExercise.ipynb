    "The volcano Hekla is at the margin of Iceland's Eastern Volcanic Zone ([see it on the geological map](https://arcgisserver.isor.is/?lon=-19.65797&lat=63.98897&zoom=13&_ga=2.98804317.2103429531.1682513440-734776706.1680257934&_gl=1*8rzm79*_ga*Njk1NTI2Njg0LjE3MDQzMDI3NDA.*_ga_SYHREZS7XD*MTcwNjAxNTgzNy40LjEuMTcwNjAxNTg4NC4wLjAuMA..&layers%5B%5D=satellite&layers%5B%5D=geologyDetailed&layers%5B%5D=names)). The last time Hekla erupted was in 2000, but prior to that it had erupted approximately every 10 years. Notably, lava compositions from basalt to rhyolite have been erupted, but the origin of this compositional diversity is debated. One model proposes that the silicic melts are produced by melting of hydrothermally altered crust [(e.g., Sigmarsson et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00410-021-01883-5), with compositionally intermediate melts formed by mixing between the mafic (mantle derived) basaltic melt and this silicic crustal melt. Alternatively, it is suggested that the entire compositional suite can be formed by fractional crystallisation of basaltic melt [(e.g., Geist et al., 2021)](http://www.doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egab001).\n",

    "In this practical you will use thermodynamic modelling to assess whether fractional crystallisation is a viable model for explaining the diversity in magma compositions.\n",
